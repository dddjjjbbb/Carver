With speed and accuracy, Carver aims to facilitate the generation of large data sets without use of the Goodreads API.

# How to install

To run these services, you'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You'll also need the following Python libraries:

- [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)
- [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)
- [chromedriver-py](https://pypi.org/project/chromedriver-py/)
- [geckodriver-autoinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/geckodriver-autoinstaller/)
- [lxml](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser)
- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html)
- [webdriver_manager](https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/webdriver_manager)

You can do so by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, you'll need a web browser â€” either Chrome or Firefox. 
We've found Carver tends to function better with Firefox.

# How to use

We recommend running these services from the command line, as the usage instructions below describe.

## Config

We recommend running these services from the command line, as the usage instructions below describe.

## Config

Many defaults can be configured via the project `config.ini`.

You'll currently find fields related to book/author metadata.

Under `[BOOK]` or `[AUTHOR]`, mark fields as either `True` or `False` and corresponding limits as desired.

e.g. if you're not interested in exporting the genres to which a book belongs, change `GENRES = True` to `GENRES = False`

# Tests

Should you wish to extend Carver or simply check everything is working as expected, please follow the instructions below.

Run tests with `python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/` from root.

You can also functionally test all services by running the follow shell script:

`sh example/shell/test_script.sh`

# Collect Book Metadata

You can use the below commands to collect metadata about books on Goodreads, 
such as the total number of Goodreads reviews and ratings, average Goodreads rating, 
and most common Goodreads "shelves" for each book.

### Input

This service takes as input a list of book id titles, stored in a plain text file with one book id title per line. 
Book id titles are unique to Goodreads and can be found at the end of a book's URL. 
For example, the book id title for *Little Women* 
([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1934.Little_Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1934.Little_Women)) 
is `1934.Little_Women`.

Note: If you don't have these ids to hand but only a list of books/authors, Carver can automate the process for you, 
see: [Generate Book Ids](#generate-book-ids)

### Output

The service outputs a JSON file for each book with the information marked as `True` under `[BOOK_DATA]` in `config.ini`. 
By default, all values listed will be included in the output.

This service also outputs an aggregated JSON file with information about all the books that have been scraped. 
To output an aggregated CSV file in addition to a JSON file, use the flag `--format CSV`.

### Usage

Note: JSON is the default export format if not explicitly provided

`python main.py -s book -bip example/data/goodreads_classics_sample.txt -odp user_io/output/ -f csv`

# Collect Book Reviews

Note: JSON is the default export format if not explicitly provided

`python main.py --service book -bip example/data/goodreads_classics_sample.txt --output_directory_path user_io/output/ -f csv`

or

`python main.py -s book -bip example/data/goodreads_classics_sample.txt -odp user_io/output/ -f csv`

# Collect Book Reviews

You can use the review service to collect reviews and review metadata about books on Goodreads, 
including the text of the review, star rating, username of the reviewer, number of likes, 
and categories or "shelves" that the user has tagged for the book.

### Input

This service takes as input a list of book IDs, stored in a plain text file with one book ID per line. 

### Output

This service takes as input a list of book IDs, stored in a plain text file with one book ID per line. 

### Output

This service outputs a JSON file for each book with the following information:

- book ID and title
- book ID
- book title
- review URL
- review ID
- date
- rating
- username of the reviewer
- text
- number of likes the review received from other users
- shelves to which the reviewer added the book

To output an aggregated CSV file in addition to a JSON file, use the flag `--format csv`.

Goodreads only allows the first 10 pages of reviews to be shown for each book. 
There are 30 reviews per page, so you should expect a maximum of 300 reviews per book. 

By default, the reviews are sorted by their popularity. 

They can also be sorted chronologically to show either the newest or oldest reviews.

- `sort_order` can be set to `default`,`newest` or `oldest`.

We also select a filter to only show English language reviews. 

### Usage

`python src/review/review_service.py --book_ids_path example/data/goodreads_classics_sample.txt --output_directory_path . --browser firefox --sort_order newest --format json`

- `browser` can be set to `chrome` or `firefox`. 
- `format` can be set to `JSON` (default) or `CSV`.

# Generate Book Id Titles

You can use the service `book_id` to collect book id titles which can then be used as input to any of the above services.

### Input

You can use the service `book_id` to collect book id titles which can then be used as input to any of the above services.

### Input

This service takes as input a list of queries stored as plain text with one `book_title - book_author` per line.
The default location of this file is `user_io/input/goodreads_queries.txt`
The delimiter can be whatever you wish, but it must be specified in the config file: `config.ini` (the default is " - ") 

### Output

For matches, this service outputs a book id title for each book here `user_io/output/matches/matches.txt`
For no matches, the service outputs the original query here `user_io/output/matches/no_matches.txt`

### Usage

`python main.py -s book_id`

For matches, this service outputs a book id title for each book here `user_io/output/matches/matches.txt`
For no matches, the service outputs the original query here `user_io/output/matches/no_matches.txt`

### Usage

`python main.py -s book_id`

Should you wish to change the match percentages or output paths, you can do so in the `config.ini`.

Percentages are currently set as follows:

`BOOK_TITLE_SIMILARITY_PERCENTAGE = 0.6`
`AUTHOR_NAME_SIMILARITY_PERCENTAGE = 0.7`

We found these to be sane defaults during testing, but it really will depend on your use case, feel free to experiment :)

# Glossary

- `book_id_title` corresponds to the id contained in the goodreads URL, 
  e.g. `587393.The_Lost_Scrapbook` in `https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587393.The_Lost_Scrapbook`
- `numeric_book_id` corresponds to the numeric section of the book_id_title, 
  e.g. `587393` in `587393.The_Lost_Scrapbook`

# Acknowledgements

Carver is a fork of the excellent `goodreads-scraper` project 
started by [Maria Antoniak](https://github.com/maria-antoniak) and [Melanie Walsh](https://github.com/melaniewalsh). 

It was motivated by moving that project forward given time constraints on the part of the original owners. 
Plus the vision/intention is slightly different. For a list of changes/motivation see: 
[changes](./changes.md)

I am indebted to them for their initial efforts and thank them for helping to get this project off the ground.
For full details of the original project, please see [the repo](https://github.com/maria-antoniak/goodreads-scraper).

# Notes

- Updates to the Goodreads website may break this code. 
We don't guarantee that Carver will continue to work in the future.
Feel free to post an issue if you run into a problem.
  
- The refactoring effort will continue for the next month or so. **This extends in particular to the reviews service 
which at the time of writing has received the least attention.**
