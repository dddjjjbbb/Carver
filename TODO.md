- Discuss project name change (a few other projects with this name)
- Setup CI with Travis
    - Setup main/prod branch
- Discuss Author Module
- Discuss config export options
- Error handling
- Async

# Additional Ideas

- Write an API
- Write tool to calculate diversity percentage
- Refactor reviews service, so it's not dependent on Selenium (Selenium is slow and brittle)
- Continue to extend tests (make it a mandatory requirement to commit)
- Include PR template to ensure standard is kept high
