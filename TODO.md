# Points to note

- Jupyter (out of date)
- Having not refactored reviews

# Additional Ideas

- Project name change (see README)
  - There a few other projects with this name
- Setup CI with Travis
    - Setup main/prod branch
- Write an API
- Write tool to calculate diversity percentage
- Refactor reviews service, so it's not dependent on Selenium (Selenium is slow and brittle)
- Continue to extend tests (make it a mandatory requirement to commit)
- Include PR template to ensure standard is kept high
